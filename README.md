# Homework: Events Finder — UI Programming (UI = f(state))

## Goal
Build a small state-driven interface in vanilla JavaScript that supports **search + filter + sort + feedback**.

You should practice the UI programming loop:
**Events → update state → render UI → user sees feedback**

---

## Getting started

### Option A: VS Code + Live Server (recommended)
1. Install VS Code.
2. Install the extension **Live Server** (publisher: Ritwick Dey).
3. Open this folder in VS Code.
4. Right-click `index.html` → **Open with Live Server**.

### Option B: No extension
Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.
(You will need to refresh the page after changes.)

## Completion checklist (what to do)
Work in `app.js` and do your best to implement the TODOs:

- [x] Implement `compareByDate(a, b)` (sort ascending/descending)
- [x] Implement `getVisibleEvents()` (filter + sort based on `state`)
- [x] Implement `render()` (status line + results list + empty state)
- [x] Implement `wireEvents()` (event listeners update `state` then call `render()`)

### Architecture guideline (helps you succeed)
- Keep truth in `state` (query, filter, sort).
- Event handlers update state and call `render()`.
- `render()` reads from state and updates the DOM.

## Reflection (required — put answers in this README before submitting)
Answer in 2–4 sentences each:

1. **Learnability:** What feedback would you want the UI to show after user actions? Why does it help?

The page should change as the user interacts with the UI. For example, a searchbar should be highlighted when its selected. As the user types out a query, the listings should update in real time. If the listings have to load due to a large data set, a loading screen should be shown so that the user knows the process is working and not frozen. This helps the user understand the results of their actions and whether or not the website is working.

2. **Efficiency:** What feature in this UI reduces effort/time for common tasks? Why?

The checkbox for Free Only and the sorting modes help increase efficiency. Free Only allows a user to look for free events faster. Sorting modes help the user find certain extremes quickly.

3. **Safety:** What would prevent confusion or errors? (e.g., empty state, clear status, preventing invalid states)

If the user's search results with nothing, there should be a message telling the user nothing matches their search. Search engines should not be case sensitive and should be a little forgiving with spelling.

## Submission (graded on completion)
Submit these files:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `app.js`
- `README.md` (with your reflection answers included)

### Grading (completion-based)
This homework is graded on **completion**, not correctness.
- Full credit if you:
  - made a sincere attempt at the TODOs in `app.js`, and
  - included the reflection answers in `README.md`.

If your code isn’t fully working, that’s okay — submit what you have. Your goal is to practice the mental model and identify what you’d fix next.

## Optional exercises (not graded — for mastery)
Pick any 1–3 if you want extra practice:

1. **Persistence (+1 skill):** Save `{query, freeOnly, sort}` to `localStorage` on each change; restore on load.
2. **Keyboard shortcut:** Press `/` to focus the search box.
3. **Extra filter:** Add a venue dropdown filter generated from the data.
4. **Async UI:** Simulate loading with a “Loading…” state for 500ms before showing results.
5. **Safety upgrade:** Add a “Clear filters” button and show a confirmation *only* if it would discard typed input.
6. **Accessibility upgrade:** Add a “Skip to results” link and ensure focus order is logical.

(You don’t need to submit these; they’re for your own practice.)
